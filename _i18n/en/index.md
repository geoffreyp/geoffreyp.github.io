I am a [doctor](/en/thesis) in computer science, recently graduated from the University of Lille ([Cristal](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?rubrique27&eid=47) / [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/equipes/bonus)). My work focuses on multi-objective optimization and more particularly on the decomposition of multi-objective problems.

I am currently a project holder at the [Inria Startup Studio](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-startup-studio). The project consists in optimizing multiobjective urban mobility problems.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Multiobjective optimization
- [MOEA/D algorithm](https://sites.google.com/view/moead/home)
- [BigMO Project](https://sites.google.com/view/bigmo/home)
