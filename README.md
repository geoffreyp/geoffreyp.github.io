✨ This theme is entirely free and open source. We welcome your ideas, feedback, and contributions! If you find it useful, please give it a GitHub star to show your support.

## Quickstart

#### Install Hugo

This is a theme for the website generator Hugo. To use it, you must install Hugo by following [the official guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

**We recommend installing the theme as a [Hugo module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) (recommended, and explained below).** This is the most powerful way to install the theme, will allow you to combine it with other modules, and is probably the easiest way to update across theme versions.

Another alternative is to use [git submodules](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#create-a-site) or to [download the theme as a zip file](https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme/releases) and copy the files to your site`*`. But that will make your site "stuck in time" and more difficult to upgrade. **This is not recommended or supported directly**.

> **On the release files:** `*` from the version `v1.5.4` the theme available as a zip file in the [releases page](https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme/releases) contains the `node_modules` folder, so you don't need to install it separately. This is a convenience for edge cases that might have problems installing the theme as a module or downloading many files.__

### As a Hugo Module (recommended)

> **Note:** Before proceeding, **Ensure you have Go and Hugo installed** and that you have created a new Hugo project.
As a pre-requirement, you will need Hugo set up and running. You can follow [the official guide for it](https://gohugo.io/categories/installation/).

The theme has been tested with Hugo version `0.136` (extended version). If you get errors regarding missing functionalities, check if you have the latest version of Hugo available.

**Note:** as mentioned, the theme supports both Hugo modules and git submodules. You should use Hugo modules to install the theme in the most maintainable way. If you prefer git submodules you can follow these [older instructions](https://gohugobrasil.netlify.app/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) or the next ones as help:

<details>
<summary>Step-by-step instructions to setup the theme as a hugo module</summary>

1. Create a new Hugo site (this will create a new folder): `hugo new site <your website's name>`
1. Enter the newly created folder: `cd <your website's name>/`
1. Initialize the Hugo Module system in your site if you haven't already: `hugo mod init github.com/username/your-site` (_you don't need to host your website on GitHub, you can add anything as a name_)
1. Install the theme as a module: `hugo mod get -u github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme`
1. Add the following to your `hugo.toml`, to set the theme as active: 

```
[module]
[[module.imports]]
path = "github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme"
```

6. Prepare the `package.json` file: `hugo mod npm pack`
7. Install the dependencies: `npm install`. This will include Bootstrap (needed for styling) and the helper script [adritian-theme-helper](https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-theme-helper). 
8. Run the initial content downloader: `./node_modules/@zetxek/adritian-theme-helper/dist/scripts/download-content.js`. This will download the demo content from the [adritian-demo](https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-demo) repository and copy it to your site, for a quick start (including translations, images, configuration and content)
</details>


### Running the site

The initial configuration allows you to have a base to edit and adapt to your site, and see the available functionalities.
**Make sure to edit `baseURL`, `title` and `description`**. You can edit the header links, as well as the languages to your needs.

After you have installed the `npm` packages and setup the initial contents, you can

1. Start Hugo with `hugo server`...
1. 🎉 The theme is alive on http://localhost:1313/

For next steps and guidance on where to customize your content, [check the demo site](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/). 
You can check the demo site help page for other installation methods (such as submodules or manual configuration). 

### Additional features and configuration

The theme is extensible and customizable in multiple areas, and it can be tricky to figure out exactly what to edit. This is a guide (that is complemented by the [demo site](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/)).

<img width="1395" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/270c4445-5354-441a-ab23-21d91762e33c" />

#### Multi-language support

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/030e765a-275f-4141-88e0-b854ebe551da

The theme implements the [internationalization (i18n) system by Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/), to enable multilingual sites.

See the content in the  `i18n` folder to edit the translations, and the configuration `hugo.toml` to define your active languages. The example site has 3 enabled languages (`en` for English, `es` for Spanish and `fr` for French).

You can add additional languages, or disable the provided ones (by setting `disabled` to `true` on the languages you don't need).

Most of the content is expected to be translated via the content system of Hugo:

- [by file name](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#translation-by-file-name)
- [by content directory](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#translation-by-content-directory) 

Note: The introduction of i18n support was done in the version `v1.3.0` and it has breaking changes due to the way in which the content was managed. You can read about the upgrade path in [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md). In the version `v1.7.0` the usage of Hugo's content management was expanded, to use less `i18n` strings and more file name/content directory based translations.

#### Editing the theme content

You can check the repository [adritian-demo](https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-demo) for a reference implementation, as well as the [theme website](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/) (https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/), to get a visual guide on how to edit the content. 

Following the initial setup instructions you will get a "ready-to-use" version of the site, with sample content for you to edit and customize.

#### Technical Skills Showcase

The theme includes a dedicated Technical Skills showcase section that allows you to visually display your skills with progress bars and categorization:

- Create a `/skills` section in your site with customizable skill categories
- Each skill can include name, proficiency level, years of experience, and description
- Visual skill bars automatically use your theme's primary color
- Full dark mode support with appropriate contrast
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Accessible through navigation menu with multilingual support

To use this feature, create a `skills/_index.md` file with structured front matter for your skill categories and individual skills. The theme will automatically generate a visually appealing skills showcase page.

#### Shortcodes

The theme has multiple shortcodes available for use in the content, so you can customize your homepage (or any other page) as you want. You can read about them in the [shortcodes page](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/blog/shortcodes). Since version `v1.7.0,` this is the preferred way to set up your theme content and translations, as that's the most flexible system.

You can see the shortcodes in use in the demo site's pages, like

- [home page](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/) [`(source)`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zetxek/adritian-demo/refs/heads/main/content/home/home.md)
- [CV page](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/cv) [`(source)`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zetxek/adritian-demo/refs/heads/main/content/cv.md)

#### Contact form
_(optional, if you want to use the contact form)_ edit the key `contact` in your `homepage.yml` file, to customize your mail address. Sign up in [formspree](https://formspree.io) to redirect mails to your own.

It can be rendered in any page via the `contact-section` shortcode.

#### Blog

Two layouts are available for the blog:
- `default` (full-width for posts)
- `sidebar` (sidebar with recent posts and categories)

| Default Layout | Sidebar Layout |
|---------------|----------------|
| ![Default blog layout with full width content](https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme/raw/main/images/blog-default.jpeg) | ![Blog layout with sidebar showing recent posts](https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme/raw/main/images/blog-sidebar.jpeg) |
| Full width posts | Posts with left sidebar |
| Clean, focused reading experience | Shows recent posts and categories |
| Maximizes content area | 25% width sidebar by default |
| Best for image-heavy posts | Helps with site navigation |

<img width="1271" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1821a3b7-f572-4958-8c4f-bd1687cc8f71">


To use the blog, you can use the content type "blog", and render it in the URL `/blog`.
You can add a menu link to it in `hugo.toml`.

The posts will be markdown files stored in the `content/blog` folder.

The layout can be configured in the `hugo.toml` file, under the `[params.blog]` section.

#### (Job) Experience

This functionality and content is especially suited for personal professional sites, showcasing the work experience: 

<img width="1444" alt="SCR-20240624-uaoi" src="https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme/assets/240085/9ea86d6a-62c6-4c4f-96ba-8450fa24dd68">

It can be used to render job experience, projects and/or clients. Each experience/project has a duration, job title, company name, location and description/excerpt as well as a longer text. 

The experience is managed through a specific content type (see `content/experience` for an example).
You can use `hugo new experience/experience-name.md` (replacing `experience-name` by the name of the job experience).
This will create the content in the `content/experience` folder, following the `experience` archetype.

The following fields are used from the file's Front Matter: `title`, `jobTitle`, `company`, `location`, `duration`. 
You can find a sample experience file content here:

```
---
date: 2007-12-01T00:00:00+01:00
draft: false
title: "Job #1"
jobTitle: "Junior Intern"
company: "Internet Affairs Inc. "
location: "Stavanger, Norway"
duration: "2022-2024"

---
### Fixing the world, one byte at a time

The beginning of a great career. 
```

The experience can be displayed in several locations and different styles:

| Shortcode usage | Experience page | Single experience item | Print-friendly list |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| ![Experience list with shortcode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e974632-824c-494c-9dbc-67bb96992517) | ![Experience page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad53f815-2bd4-4723-a9a1-28be2c01461a) | ![Single experience page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97a20b98-df5c-4e07-9b2e-d7aba75ec81b) | ![CV Experience](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d2d7e4b-a23c-4be7-9617-da7232ea11a7) |
| Experience list rendered via shortcode | Experience list in /experience | Experience item in in single page | Full-width print-friendly experience 
| [🔗](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/#experience-single) By using the shortcode `experience-section`: in a page (such as your homepage), with a limited number of experiences (controlled by the config parameter `homepageExperienceCount` in the file `hugo.toml`). The summary is displayed, as well as an introduction text and optional links | [🔗](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/experience) Automatically, in the **Experience page**, in `/experience`, with a list of all experiences (no limit). The summary is displayed for each item, as well as a introduction text and optional links. | [🔗](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/experience/job-1/) Individual experience page (such as `/experience/job-1`), where all details are displayed, and links to the other descriptions are available to navigate. | [🔗](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/cv) Using the shortcode `experience-list` you can generate a list of experience that is not interactive - good for print-friendly layouts.
