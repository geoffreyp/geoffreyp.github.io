## 1st job: Junior Intern

The beginning of a great career. As a Junior Intern at Internet Affairs Inc., I had the opportunity to work on various projects that helped me develop my technical and professional skills. Working alongside experienced developers, I contributed to the company's core web applications and learned industry best practices in software development.

During my internship, I took the initiative to create an internal documentation wiki that improved knowledge sharing across teams. This project taught me valuable lessons in technical writing and collaboration. I also participated in code reviews and daily stand-ups, gaining firsthand experience in agile development methodologies.

My most notable achievement was developing an automated testing script that reduced QA time by 25%. This project not only improved team efficiency but also demonstrated my ability to identify problems and implement effective solutions. Additionally, I actively participated in the company's mentorship program, where I helped onboard new interns and shared my growing knowledge with peers.

Through these experiences, I built a strong foundation in software development and professional collaboration, setting the stage for my advancement to more senior roles within the company.
